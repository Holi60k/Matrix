# Matrix
Just a Gauss eliminator, Determinant counter and other stuff...

Just compile the file and then you can use it.

Make a matrix, for example 2x2 with real numbers.
Matrix<float> A(2,2);

Then you can add elements like this
A << 2 << 4 << 3 << 1;
And it means 
2 4
3 1
Matrix.

And then you can use it for linear equation systems as well.
